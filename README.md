c+h always (unless name says otherwise) 
usually w2i. i am usually doing something else. 
do not copy my skins. inspiration is fine.
interest in ponytown ebbs & flows. i could be playing it daily for a couple weeks and not at all the next. 
i have a terrible memory... i may forget who you are :( sorry

hyperfixated on gorillaz & the magnus archives

im also primarily in the object show fandom

my favorite bands are gorillaz and talking heads. i primarily listen to new wave and dabble in other genres. mostly rock genres.

im a selfshipper. primary f/os are noodle (gorillaz) and gerry keay (tma). i'm selectively sharing. 

proship dni. i am not comfortable with you interacting. gorillaz fandom interact with caution; i get very worked up over fanon interpretation. do not talk to me about murdad or most ships (especially noodle ships. things like 2russ and 2dace are fine anything else is on thin ice)
